  topic: "Wikidata for Digital Scholarship"
  poster: "<p>One of the strengths of the 'network' model of institutional infrastructure for digital scholarship is its agility and flexibility over time (Maron and Pickle 2014). One of its potential weaknesses, however, is lack of leadership or coordination of an evolving array of nodes in the network. Wikidata can help with that, at least conceptually, by giving unique identifiers to dynamic projects, personnel, technological tools, funding programs, and institutional or departmental affiliations. Wikidata can be used to describe key parts of a network and the relationships between them. This digital poster will show examples and offer tips on getting started.</p>"

This model will facilitate an understanding of the environment and lived space in this complex and multifaceted city, such as the role of urban space and movement in the life of the city and the relationship between the urban and religious topographies of the site. The project aims to illuminate these aspects of Durene life through spatial visualization and geospatial analysis.</p>
  <p>As well as serving as a research tool and as a public-facing piece of scholarly work, a primary focus of Digital Dura is the research process itself. This process is embedded in undergraduate research on the Roman Near East and a reflective examination of the methods of digital history centered around participation in an undergraduate course at Bates College: Rome and the East: Digitizing and Communicating History. In each iteration of this course (3 in total), students engage with primary and secondary evidence and develop their ability to link textual, visual, and material evidence. Through the process of reimagining and reconstruction of spaces, they consider the problems and limits of evidence and the practical and ethical issues involved with the of reconstruction and (re)presentation of lost spaces. The final output of each iteration of the course is a number of 3D digital models of structures within Dura, each model built and reviewed by students. These model are then compiled into an immersive virtual reality tour of Dura Europus, developed with the Unity game engine.</p>"

  topic: "Wikidata for Digital Scholarship"
  poster: "<p>In my work at the Harvard Map Collection, I sometimes create collection-level library catalog records for cartographic materials that are archival in nature, a rare subset alongside our atlas and sheet map collections. These materials, such as field notebooks containing mathematical calculations and landscape sketches, are challenging to catalog using traditional map cataloging standards. Because of the difficulty of classifying them and the limits of a non-archival cataloging environment, I have had to use precise but limited cataloging vocabulary to describe them physically, e.g. boxes containing notebooks. However, describing these materials at item-level is vitally important to map researchers, who often wish to trace the relationship between these archival documents and the maps they were used to create. Recently, I have turned to open Web solutions that can assist researchers without the adoption of new cataloging practices for the sake of a small number of outliers. Using Wikidata to apply the relational philosophy of Linked Open Data to assert connections between field notebooks, maps, and published atlases, we can demonstrate relationships of these interdependent documents. I will demonstrate this live, by showcasing information I have added to Wikidata, in the form of SPARQL queries that demonstrate relationships between resources. These queries will aid people who research archival references to map creation, including digital humanities practitioners who need to harvest cartographic data. As more libraries adopt and populate Wikidata, I believe my work presents a scalable example of how we can make existing data more expandable and efficient for ever-increasing digital approaches.</p>"

  topic: "Visualizing Nonlinear Narratives with Story Curves"
  poster: "<p>A nonlinear narrative is a storytelling device that portrays events of a story out of chronological order, e.g., in reverse order or going back and forth between past and future events. Story curves visualize the nonlinear narrative of a movie by showing the order in which events are told in the movie and comparing them to their actual chronological order, resulting in possibly meandering visual patterns in the curve. We also developed Story Explorer, an interactive tool that visualizes a story curve together with complementary information such as characters and settings. Story Explorer further provides a script curation interface that allows users to specify the chronological order of events in movies. We used Story Explorer to analyze 10 popular nonlinear movies and describe the spectrum of narrative patterns that we discovered, including some novel patterns not previously described in the literature.</p>
