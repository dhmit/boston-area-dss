  description: "<p>Michael Scott Cuthbert, Associate Professor of Music (AB ’98, AM ’01, Ph. D. ’06, Harvard University) is a musicologist who has worked extensively on music of the fourteenth-century, computational musicology, and minimalism and other music of the past forty years. His publications include seven articles on computational musicology, Ars Nova: French and Italian Music of the Fourteenth Century (with John Nádas), “Generalized Set Analysis and Sub-Saharan African Rhythm,” and “Free Improvisation: John Zorn and the Construction of Jewish Identity through Music.” Cuthbert’s current book project, Ars Mutandi, covers sacred music in Italy during the Black Death and Great Schism.</p>
  <p>His article, “Tipping the Iceberg: Missing Italian Polyphony from the Age of Schism,” used computer simulations to contradict the unquestioned assumption that most written medieval music has been lost. Cuthbert’s research lab has produced “music21,” an open-source toolkit for computer-aided musical analysis, which has an installed user base in the thousands. Cuthbert's awards include the Rome Prize in Medieval Studies, the Villa I Tatti Fellowship in Italian Renaissance Studies, and a Fellowship in Music at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. As a composer, his works have been performed by the Bang on a Can All-Stars and other groups. Prior to coming to MIT, Cuthbert was on the faculties of Smith and Mount Holyoke Colleges.</p>"

Kijas is Senior Digital Scholarship Librarian at Boston College Libraries where she develops or manages digital <a href='https://ds.bc.edu/projects/'>projects</a>, serving as project lead, or digital humanities consultant as appropriate. She provides instruction and training for faculty, students, and staff interested in applying computational tools and methods in their research and pedagogy. Her academic training includes master’s degrees in library and information science from Simmons College, music with a concentration in musicology from Tufts University, as well as a bachelor of arts in music literature and performance from Northeastern University.</p>
  <p>Anna is interested in exploring and pursuing ways in which computational methods and tools can augment scholarly writing and publishing. She has a vested interest in the exploration and application of digital humanities tools and methods in historical (music) research, and in the application of standards, including TEI and MEI, for open access research and publishing. Anna is also interested in supporting sustainable ways of developing digital projects through efforts, such as minimal computing.</p>
  <p>Among her recent publications are a chapter on the music reception of Venezuelan pianist and composer Teresa Carreño (1853-1917) as a child prodigy during her appearances in the United States, in Musical Prodigies: Interpretations from Psychology, Music Education, Musicology and Ethnomusicology, edited by Gary McPherson (Oxford University Press, 2016) as well as an <a href='http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/libr_pubs/49'>article</a> about Teresa Carreño’s role in promoting Edvard Grieg’s music, in the MLA journal Notes (2013). She also writes about using digital humanities tools and methods to explore, visualize, and augment scholarship. Anna has contributed entries for the revised editions of Grove Dictionary of American Music and Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.</p>

For more specific details on my educational background, publications, and other information, check out my <a href='https://annieswafford.wordpress.com/cv/'>Curriculum Vitae.</a></p>
  <p>As a graduate student, I built two digital humanities tools to facilitate music and literary scholarship:  <a href='http://www.songsofthevictorians.com/'>Songs of the Victorians</a>, an archive and analysis of parlor and art song settings of Victorian poems with an interactive framework that highlights each measure of a score in time with its music, and Augmented Notes, a tool that lets users build their own interdisciplinary websites like Songs of the Victorians.  (To find out more about these tools, see <a href='https://annieswafford.wordpress.com/digital-humanities-projects/'>https://annieswafford.wordpress.com/digital-humanities-projects/</a>).
