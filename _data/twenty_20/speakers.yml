  topic: Archive of African American Folklore
  description: "<p><a href='https://afamfolklore.fas.harvard.edu/'>The Archive of African American Folklore</a> aims to create a space for collecting tales and exchanging ideas about them. Much of what was told in African American storytelling circles, both at workplaces and at sites of leisure, took the form of what folklorists call ephemeral cultural property, passed on from one generation to the next, but rarely written down. This site aims to preserve the wisdom and lore of times past, showing how it has not performed a vanishing act but has been kept alive, in song and story, in conversations and performances, as well as in new expressive forms ranging from film to rap.</p>
  <p>The creation of the Archive of African American Folklore was initiated in 2017 by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. (Harvard University) and Maria Tatar (Harvard University), co-authors of Annotated African American Folktales (W.W. Norton, 2017).</p>"

  topic: Perseus Project
  description: "<p>Since planning began in 1985, the Perseus Digital Library Project has explored what happens when libraries move online. Three decades later, as new forms of publication emerge and millions of books become digital, this question is more pressing than ever. Perseus is a practical experiment in which we explore possibilities and challenges of digital collections in a networked world.</p>
  <p>Our flagship collection, under development since 1987, covers the history, literature and culture of the Greco-Roman world. We are applying what we have learned from Classics to other subjects within the humanities and beyond. We have studied many problems over the past two decades, but our current research centers on personalization: organizing what you see to meet your needs.</p>
  <p>The Perseus mission is to make the full record of humanity - linguistic sources, physical artifacts, historical spaces - as intellectually accessible as possible to every human being, regardless of linguistic or cultural background. Of course, such a mission can never be fully realized any more than we can reach the stars by which we guide the twisting paths and blind allies though the world around us. Similar instincts motivated scholars at the library at Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE, the Arab translators of Greek at Baghdad in the 9th century CE, the entrepreneurial printers of Greek and Latin in 15th century Italy, and the 19th century German scholars who built the infrastructure on which 20th century scholarship depended. None of these groups of scholars realized, of course, the fullest vision of universal knowledge that moved them. But that idealized vision allowed each to change the worlds in which they lived and carry humanity a little farther. We do not know what form such fundamental instruments as editions, lexica, encyclopedias, atlases, diagrams, museum catalogues, and archaeological site reports will assume, but we know that the infrastructure that we design now will materially enable or constrict how the next generation will be able to read languages from the past, scrutinize ancient artifacts, and explore the historical spaces.</p>
  <p>Perseus has a particular focus upon the Greco-Roman world and upon classical Greek and Latin, but the larger mission provides the distant, but fixed star by which we have charted our path for over two decades. Early modern English, the American Civil War, the History and Topography of London, the History of Mechanics, automatic identification and glossing of technical language in scientific documents, customized reading support for Arabic language, and other projects that we have undertaken allow us to maintain a broader focus and to demonstrate the commonalities between Classics and other disciplines in the humanities and beyond. At a deeper level, collaborations with colleagues outside of classical studies make good on the claim that a classical education generally provides those critical skills and that intellectual adaptability that we claim to instill in our students. We offer the combination of classical and non-classical projects that we pursue as one answer to those who worry that a classical education will leave them or their children with narrow, idiosyncratic skills.</p>
  <p>Within this larger mission, we focus on three categories of access:
    <ul>
      <li>Human readable information: digitized images of objects, places, inscriptions, and printed pages, geographic information, and other digital representations of objects and spaces. This layer of functionality allows us to call up information relevant to a longitude and latitude coordinate or a library call number. In this stage digital representations provide direct access to the physical senses of actual people in particular places and times. In some cases (such as high resolution, multi-spectral imaging), digital sources already provide better physical access than has ever been feasible when human beings had direct contact with the physical artifact.</li>
      <li>Machine actionable knowledge: catalogue records, encyclopedia articles, lexicon entries, and other structured information sources. Physical access can serve our senses but provides no information about what we are encountering - in effect, physical access is like visiting a historical site about which we may know nothing and where any visible documentation is in a language that we cannot understand. Machine actionable knowledge allows us to retrieve information about what we are viewing. Thus, if we encounter a page from a Greek manuscript of Homer, we could at this stage find cleanly printed modern editions of the Greek, modern language translations, commentaries and other background information about the passage on that manuscript page. If we moved through a virtual Acropolis, we could retrieve background information about the buildings and the sculpture.</li>
      <li>Machine generated knowledge: By analyzing existing information automated systems can produce new knowledge. Machine actionable knowledge allows, for example, us to look up a dictionary entry (e.g., facio, 'to do, make') in a dictionary or to find pre-existing translations for a passage in Latin or Greek. Machine generated knowledge allows a machine to recognize that fecisset is a pluperfect subjunctive form of facio and to provide reading support where there is no pre-existing human translation. Such reading support might include full machine translation but also finer grained services such as word and phrase translation (e.g., recognizing whether orationes in a given context more likely corresponds to English 'speeches,' 'prayers' or some other term), syntactic analysis (e.g., recognizing that orationes in a given passage is the object of a given verb), named entity identification (e.g., identifying Antonium in a given passage as a personal name and then as a reference to Antonius the triumvir).</li>

  bio: "<p>Gregory Crane's interests are twofold. On the one hand, he has published on a wide range of ancient Greek authors (including articles on Greek drama and Hellenistic poetry and a book on the Odyssey). Much of his traditional scholarly work has been devoted to Thucydides; his book The Blinded Eye: Thucydides and the New Written Word appeared from Rowman and Littlefield in 1996; his second Thucydides book (The Ancient Simplicity: Thucydides and the Limits of Political Realism) was published by the University of California Press in 1998.</p>
  <p>At the same time, he has a long-standing interest in the relationship between the humanities and rapidly developing digital technology. He began this side of his work as a graduate student at Harvard when the Classics Department purchased its first TLG authors on magnetic tape in the summer of 1982. He developed a Unix-based full text retrieval system for the TLG that was widely used in North America and Europe in the middle 1980s. He also helped establish a typesetting consortium to facilitate scholarly publishing. Since 1985 he has been engaged in planning and development of the Perseus Project, which he directs as the Editor-in-Chief. Besides supervising the Perseus Project as a whole, he has been primarily responsible for the development of the morphological analysis system which provides many of the links within the Perseus database.</p>
  <p>From 1998 through 2006 he directed a grant from the Digital Library Initiative to study general problems of digital libraries in the humanities. Under the DLI-2 program, he worked on a range of topics, including such topics as London, the history of Mechanics, and the American Civil War. Each of these collections provided new insights into the implications of such new electronic tools on learning. In 2006, he produced a named entity identification system, published a 55 million word collection, and authored several publications describing the system.</p>
  <p>With the rise of the Google Books project in 2004, he began to focus upon the problems and opportunities that arise when whole libraries rather than curated collections become available on-line. The broad range of projects that he suppported with support from the DLI-2 program, the Institute for Museum and Library Services, and the Mellon Foundation provided a broad foundation within which to frame his current generation of research projects on Classical Studies at Perseus. Crane overees the overall research program at Perseus.</p>
  <p>Crane is especially interested in helping the emerging Cyberinfrastructure serve the needs of the humanities in general and classical studies in particular.</p>"

  bio: "<p>A specialist in Italian Renaissance and Baroque art and architecture with a focus on Rome, Stephanie Leone studies the topics of patronage, the papal court, secular architecture, architectural production, the building industry, art collecting, and material culture. Her publications include a monograph on the Palazzo Pamphilj in Piazza Navona, an edited volume on the art patronage of the Pamphilj family, and articles and chapters on the art and architecture of palaces, the Pamphilj art collections, and other subjects. Along with traditional art historical methods, Professor Leone employs digital technology in her research and teaching. She is using historical network analysis in her monographic study of Pope Innocent X’s patronage and the architectural production of his building sites in mid-seventeenth-century Rome, which will result in the book, <em>Innocent X Pamphilj (1644-1655): Building Baroque Rome.</em></p>
  <p>Professor Leone teaches the introduction to art history and upper-level courses on the Early Renaissance, High Renaissance, and Baroque periods in Italy (ca. 1300-1750). In the Core Curriculum, she teaches an Enduring Questions course on Venetian art, architecture and the environment, which is paired with an Earth and Environmental Sciences course on coastal geology and development. In undergraduate seminars, she explores topics related to her research, such as Italian palaces and the history of collections and museums. Using digital technology in course projects, her students become collaborators in the iterative process of research and knowledge.</p>"
  topic: Pope Innocent X Pamphilj's Architectural Network in Baroque Rome
  description: "<p>No one would deny that the artist-patron relationship between Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Pope Urban VIII Barberini (r. 1623-1644) was one of the most innovative in the history of art and architecture, but this emphasis on celebrities overlooks an important part of the story of urban renewal in early modern Rome. In addition, it has led to the misconception that the patronage of Pope Innocent X Pamphilj (r. 1644-1655) pales in comparison to other seventeenth-century popes.</p>
  <p>My project proposes a new paradigm that de-emphasizes singular relationships and programmatic themes and instead stresses the processes of artistic production and the mechanics of patronage. This approach suits the practices of Innocent X and his relatives, who harnessed a stable-full of creative and skilled architects, artists, and artisans to realize multiple building projects, such as the nave decoration of St. Peter’s, the nave of St. John the Lateran, the New Palace on the Capitoline Hill, the Palazzo Pamphilj in Piazza Navona, and Bernini’s <em>Four Rivers Fountain</em>. To investigate architectural production, I combine traditional art historical practices with historical network analysis. This method reveals the mediating function of skilled workers ranked below architects and designing sculptors in the building industry’s professional hierarchy and demonstrates the capability to intercede was dispersed among various specializations, such as masons, stonecutters, and glaziers. The mediating potential of artisans challenges existing expectations about architectural history. Furthermore, the network analysis positions Innocent X as the patron of a productive architectural enterprise populated by steadfast and talented skilled workers.</p>"

  topic: Imagine All the People
  description: "<p><em>Imagine All the People</em> uses large corpora of British and Danish literature to understand the deep cultural roots of education reform. The book project explores the puzzling differences between British and Danish education systems, and the impacts of these systems on the economic fortunes of low-skill youth. The poor, rural and backward country of Denmark surprisingly became a world leader in public, mass primary education (1814) and secondary vocational training, whereas Britain – the leader of the industrial revolution – created public mass schooling first in 1870 and developed only general secondary education.</p>
  <p>Martin argues that narratives of literature are crucially important to stories of policy divergence, as British and Danish schooling reforms were associated with different cultural scripts about the individual in society and the role of education. British narratives highlighted benefits of schooling for individual self-growth (for upper/middle classes). Reformers later demanded equality of educational opportunity to allow even working class youth to enjoy self-growth; to this end, they insisted that mass education be humanistic rather than vocational to prevent a two-tiered educational system. Danish narratives justified schooling as a social investment to strengthen society and to help each citizen contribute; this facilitated both the early establishment of a public school system and a diversity of educational tracks to meet varied skill demands.</p>
  <p>These historical struggles have implications for contemporary political concerns. Scandinavian stories point to the advantages of framing policy interventions in terms of social investments to build a strong society rather than as redistribution among competing groups. Commitment to a strong society drove Danish investments in educational innovations: neglect of low-skill youth was viewed as a waste of societal resources and a threat to social fabric. High socioeconomic equality was a fortuitous but felicitous side effect of this mandate to educate all the people.</p>
  <p>The British form of secondary education has had limited practical value for low-skill workers and has ultimately reinforced inequality. Moreover the individualistic cultural attitudes of British educational reformers have paradoxically permitted growing socioeconomic inequities. British stories justified the neglect of marginal youth, because celebration of those conquering challenges with self-initiative made it easier to blame those who fail and to dismiss the youth that are left behind. Yet as today’s episodes of terror and instability constantly remind us, individual losers may well be society’s losses.</p>"

  topic: Encyclopedia of the Variant Readings of the Qurʾān
  description: "<p>Since the publication of the 1923 first official Egyptian print of the Qurʾān, most Arabs and Muslims became familiar with only one variety of the Qurʾān. This variety is one out of twenty other standard varieties of the Qurʾān all acknowledged by Muslim orthodoxy. The demarcation of what is canonical and what is not was not applied systematically throughout the Muslim world over the past 14 centuries. Up until the 20th century, Muslims recited, memorized, and taught many other varieties of the Qurʾān, varieties or Readings which are nowadays considered to be obsolete and non-canonical. It was only after the publication of the official Qurʾān by al-Azhar-Egypt in 1923, and the first complete Audio recording of the whole Qurʾān by the renowned Egyptian Qurʾān reciter al-Ḥuṣarī, that the other system Readings of the Qurʾān were eclipsed by the now 'official' version, to the extent that most of these variants became forgotten and unknown to the modern lay Muslim and even scholars of Islam.</p>
  <p>My project, Encyclopedia of the Variant Readings of the Qurʾān (EvQ), aims to be the foundation of a critical edition of the Qurʾān. The unsuccessful scholarly attempts to establish anything close to a critical edition were/are mainly due to the conventionally held notion that critical editions must rely on physical manuscripts. The main obstacle that scholars face is the fact that the Qurʾān, as we know it today and as it existed for centuries, is not based on a Masoretic tradition. The most important defining characteristic of the Qurʾān is often neglected, namely, its orality.<p>
  <p>EvQ aims to develop a flexible online interface through which one can easily utilize the data and access it through different filtering modules. Moreover, the project will add comprehensive Audio recordings of the entire Qurʾān in all its documented variant traditions gleaned from a plethora of classical Arabic sources. Verse-by-verse and variant-by-variant recordings in all the proposed system Readings are crucial to this project. The academic community must have open access to a smart and flexible online interface where one can simply click on any verse and listen to how it is recited in its different textual and oral variant forms.</p>"

  topic: The Encoded 14th-century Franciscan Antiphoner
  description: "<p>Among the rare musical treasures housed at Boston College’s John J. Burns Library, is an early 14th-century Franciscan Antiphoner (<a href='http://burnsantiphoner.bc.edu'>http://burnsantiphoner.bc.edu</a>). Bound between leather-covered boards, the volume now comprises 119 parchment folios containing Gregorian chants for the entire annual calendar of saints’ days (the sanctorale). While the precise date and provenance of the manuscript remain a mystery, there is reason to believe that it was copied by a German scribe, probably for use in Germany. Rather than a luxury manuscript distinguished by superb calligraphy and expert illumination, this volume was copied for daily use by monks chanting the divine office. For its interest to both specialists and the wider public, it was chosen as one of the few BC library holdings to be represented in the 2016 exhibition <em>Beyond Words: Illuminated Manuscripts in Boston Collections</em> (<a href='http://beyondwords2016.org'>http://beyondwords2016.org</a>).</p>
  <p>The Antiphoner contains 846 musical works and although the BC library had already made the entire volume available online as an open access digital object, none of those 846 musical works was indexed or searchable. Our project sought to provide deeper access and interactive functionality for both students and researchers accessing the object online, as well as for the public attending the 2016 <em>Beyond Words</em> exhibition. First, to maximize user experience and to make the content analyzable, the project incorporated encoded metadata providing a means of searching each of the melodic incipits. This means that the first melodically meaningful phrase of each chant, identifying it uniquely, was encoded so that the presence of any known chant in the manuscript could easily be established through searchable incipits. The digitized object and encoded content was thus made available via a responsive website. Second, the project sought to provide museum-goers with an opportunity to experience and interact with the Antiphoner digitally via a multi-touch table. In addition, we sought to enhance the images of the source with videos and audio clips of specially commissioned recordings of the music preserved in the Antiphoner. Through the addition of explanatory texts together with audio and video recordings of performances of some of the Antiphoner’s melodies, we sought to bring the audience into closer and richer contact with the artifact than would have been possible with the physical object alone.</p>
  <p>Additionally, access to the raw data files of encoded content offers additional analytical tools for scholars and students. While the <em>Beyond Words</em> exhibition presented us with the opportunity to offer a rich multi-media experience to the museum-goer, we set our sights firmly on providing a long-term project of enduring benefit to both students and researchers. In particular, through close co-operation with the international CANTUS database (<a href='http://cantusdatabase.org'>http://cantusdatabase.org</a>), we contributed to the most important scholarly database of medieval music.</p>"

  topic: Digital/Multimedia Expression, Freshman Writing, and General Education at BU
  description: "<p>In the fall of 2015, a Boston University task force on general education proposed a new requirement for undergraduates in something called Digital/Multimedia Expression (DME), suggesting that the university’s Writing Program could serve as a primary pathway for credit in that area of learning. This spring, the Writing Program rolled out more than thirty sections of a new course designed to fulfill the DME requirement. In itself, this is a significant achievement and the result of collaboration among Writing Program faculty, members of the task force, and academic staff from BU Libraries and the university’s Center for Teaching and Learning. In the process, a number of questions, both philosophical and logistical, needed to be answered. What is DME? How does it—and how should it—fit into the Writing Program curriculum and the broader undergraduate curriculum? What do faculty need to do to incorporate requisite but unfamiliar knowledge, methods, and technologies into their teaching? What material and human support is required? What organizational changes (if any) ought to be considered? As the DME requirement and the Writing Program course enter a stage of sustainability, those remain live questions, and the next several years promise to be a period of study, reflection, and also perhaps revision.</p>"
