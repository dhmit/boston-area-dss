                <p>
                Given the current circumstances surrounding COVID-19, we are postponing the Boston-Area Digital Scholarship Symposium 2020, originally scheduled for Friday, May 1, 2020 at MIT.
                </p>

                <p>
                As soon as we are able to resume planning for next Spring, we will be in touch with information about further details for #BDSS2021.
                </p>

                <p>
                Effective immediately, we are closing our call for posters. We have already received a number of excellent poster submissions,
                and we have reached out to those authors with next steps. Invited speakers will also be contacted.
                </p>
