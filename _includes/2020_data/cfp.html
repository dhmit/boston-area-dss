                    <p>
                      The organizers of the Boston Area Digital Scholarship Symposium welcome posters (physical or digital) on any aspect of digital humanities or other digital scholarship from student, staff, faculty, or non-academically unaffiliated members of the digital scholarship/digital humanities communities from the Boston area and beyond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Some poster authors may be invited to present alongside speakers selected by the program committee.  Please indicate in if you or your group are not interested in being considered for an oral presentation. Posters should either present digital projects or software tools, or explore research on new digital methods. Submitted projects and research may be at any stage of development, though we particularly encourage work that has progressed to the point of being able to offer a live demonstration. The poster session will be interactive and informal, with posters serving as jumping-off points for broader discussions.
                    </p>
