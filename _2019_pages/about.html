      <h4>Institutional Models of Collaborative Support</h4>
      <p>Digital scholarship is inherently collaborative, and researchers embracing these methods operate in a complex network and depend on extensive institutional infrastructure. The first annual Boston Area Digital Scholarship Symposium will explore how institutions can support, encourage, and preserve digital scholarship and pedagogy.</p>

      <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
      <p>The Boston Area Digital Scholarship Symposium organizers invite graduate students and university staff to submit proposals for the poster session at our first annual event. The focus of this year's symposium is "Institutional Models of Collaborative Support.” Digital scholarship is inherently collaborative, and researchers embracing these methods operate in a complex network and depend on extensive institutional infrastructure. We especially welcome poster proposals related to these themes, but the Symposium will also accept proposals on digital scholarship more broadly.</p>
      <p>Posters should either present digital projects or software tools, or explore research on new digital methods. Submitted projects and research may be at any stage of development, though we particularly encourage work that has progressed to the point of being able to offer a live demonstration. The poster session will be interactive and informal, with posters serving as jumping-off points for broader discussions.</p>
      <p>Posters may take either digital or physical form; interactive digital demonstrations are particularly encouraged. Presenters submitting digital posters should bring laptops.</p>
      <p>Poster proposals should include:
          <ul>
              <li>Title</li>
              <li>Abstract (maximum 300 words)</li>
              <li>Technical requirements</li>
              <li>Contact information for all presenters</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The deadline for submitting poster proposals is March 15. Presenters will be notified of acceptance by March 22. We will contact invited presenters for additional information, including short bios and headshots.</p>
